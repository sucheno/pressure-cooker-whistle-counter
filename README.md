# Pressure Cooker Whistle Counter

This project is a simple web application that helps users keep track of the number of whistles from a pressure cooker. It features a large button that, when clicked, increments a counter for the whistles. Once the counter reaches a predefined limit, an alert is displayed to remind the user to turn off the cooker.

## Files in the Project

- **index.html**: Contains the HTML structure of the page, including a large centered button.
- **script.js**: Contains the JavaScript code that manages the whistle counter and handles the button click events.

## How to Use

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Click the large button to increment the whistle counter.
3. Once the counter reaches the limit (default is 3 whistles), an alert will pop up stating: "Whistle limit reached, Turn off the cooker."

## Installation

No installation is required. Simply download the project files and open `index.html` in your preferred web browser.
